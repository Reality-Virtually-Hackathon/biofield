# Biofield

A realtime VR vs Mobile multiplayer game utilizing JavaScript, PhaserJS, and C#.

Perfect for the classroom, one player wearing an Oculus Rift headset represents a white blood cell within a blood vessel fighting to protect a human body from becoming ill. Players on their mobile devices can take on the roles of either powerful antibodies or troublesome bacteria and can help (or hurt) the VR player's blood cell by manipulating remotely what's happening inside the VR experience.
